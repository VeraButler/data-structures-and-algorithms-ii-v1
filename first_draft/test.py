'''
Nearest Neighbor Algorithm
1. initialize all vertices as unvisited
2. select an arbitrary vertex, set it as the current vertex u. Mark U as visited
3. find out the shortest edge connectoin the current vertex u and an unvisted vertex v
4. set v as the current vertex u. mark v as visted
5. if all the vertices in the domain are visted then terminate. Else go to step 3

k-nearest neighbor algorithm KNN

1. load data
2. Initialize K to chosen number of neighbors 
    a. K = num packages left to deliver
3. for each example in data
    a. calculate the distance between the query example and the current example from the data
    b. add the distance and the index of the example to an ordered collection
4. sort the ordered collection of distances and indices in ascending order by the distances
5. pick the first K entries from the sorted collection
6. get the labels of the selected K entries
7. If regression, return the mean of the K labels
8. If classification, return the mode of the K labels
