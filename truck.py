# Other Assumptions:
####################
# Trucks have a “infinite amount of gas” with no need to stop.
# The package ID is unique; there are no collisions.
# No further assumptions exist or are allowed.

# Delivery time is instantaneous, i.e., no time passes while at a delivery
# (that time is factored into the average speed of the trucks).

# The wrong delivery address for package #9, Third District Juvenile Court, will be corrected at 10:20 a.m.
# The correct address is 410 S State St., Salt Lake City, UT 84111.

# THOUGHTS:
# The truck is responsible for delivering up to 16 packages at 18 miles per hour.
