TRUCK CLASS ASSUMPTIONS

Trucks have a “infinite amount of gas” with no need to stop.
The package ID is unique; there are no collisions.
Delivery time is instantaneous, i.e., no time passes while at a delivery
    (that time is factored into the average speed of the trucks).
No further assumptions exist or are allowed.
The wrong delivery address for package #9, Third District Juvenile Court, will be corrected at 10:20 a.m.
    The correct address is 410 S State St., Salt Lake City, UT 84111.

        B.2 Apply programming models to the scenario.
        Simple mathematical calculations are used to convert 18/miles per hour into fractional time variables which are
        then converted to stings to be used to track total delivery time of each truck and the delivered time of each
        package. Both total delivery time of each truck and the delivered time of each package are held in memory with
        their associated locations in memory. Without the use of classes for both Truck and Package it would be
        necessary to loop through all the data of each member and would decrease performance of the method from
        O(1) to O(N^2).

        B.4 Discuss the ability of your solution to adapt to a changing market and to scalability.
              Upgrades to the physical trucks, the amount of packages that need to be delivered daily, or the expansion
              of the region of the delivery system may mean a change in miles per hour or the time it would take to
              complete a delivery route. See B.5 for why this method can be easily updated for these types of changes.

        B.5 Discuss the efficiency and maintainability of the software.
              This method is efficient and maintainable because it enables the miles per hour to be
              changed globally in the program within the Truck class. The time element is dependent upon the
              miles per hour, therefore, it will also be updated globally.
